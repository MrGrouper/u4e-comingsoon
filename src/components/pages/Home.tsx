We are developing a platform that fosters the student-teacher relationship, enhanced by AI to offer personalized tutoring. This AI assistant would adapt to each student’s pace and preferences, augmenting the traditional educational model rather than competing with it.

            We have written the code for our Platform. The interactive program connects teachers to children and children to CHATGPT . We use two different types of AI channels to protect against “hallucinations” , a common phenomenon that Bots will give convincing false answers. We think the usage of “Two brains is better than one” may be a game changer to the industry regarding this problem.

It is too early to know the Teacher-to-student Ratio, because we are uncertain of the participation of the government-run schools. but the program will be lead by certified teachers.

We have also used AI to test the system itself. This process is giving us amazing insight in the powers and concerns with this Bot Tutoring.

We are currently in the stage of testing. The speed and quality of that will depend on the amount of funds we receive from contributors.
